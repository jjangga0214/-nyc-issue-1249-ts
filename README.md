# nyc-issue-1249-js

This repo is repro for [istanbuljs/nyc#1249](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1249), only purely with `jest` and `nyc` with`js`.

## steps

```bash
npm install
# measure coverage and generate json and html report by jest
npm run coverage
# open browser and show html report generated by jest
npm run showReportByJest
# generate html report by nyc from coverage/coverage-final.json
npm run generateReportByNyc
# open browser and show html report generated by nyc
npm run showReportByNyc
```

## expected result

`html` reports by `jest` and `nyc` are both valid and identical. 
Therefore `npm run showReportByJest` and `npm run showReportByNyc` should show the exact same `html` report.

## real result executed on personal machine

It's same as expected result on ubuntu 19.04, 64 bits, node 12.6.0, npm 6.13.4.
