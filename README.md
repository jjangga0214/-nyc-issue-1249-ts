# nyc-issue-1249-js

This repository is reproduction for [istanbuljs/nyc#1249](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1249), only purely with `jest` and `nyc` with`js`.

## steps

```bash
npm install
# measure coverage and generate json and html report by jest
npm run coverage
# open browser and show html report generated by jest
npm run showReportByJest
# generate html report by nyc from coverage/coverage-final.json
npm run generateReportByNyc
# open browser and show html report generated by nyc
npm run showReportByNyc
```

## personal result

It has no problem. `html` reports by `jest` and `nyc` are both valid and identical.
